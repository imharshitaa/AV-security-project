Develop a comprehensive security solution for autonomous vehicles (AVs) to protect them from cyber threats, using tools like Aircrack-ng for wireless security assessment and Python for 
developing custom security mechanisms and automation scripts.

--------------------

Project Components
-

Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment 
- Identify potential cyber threats to AVs (e.g., wireless network attacks, software vulnerabilities, sensor spoofing).
- Conduct a risk assessment to prioritize threats based on their likelihood and potential impact.

Wireless Network Security 
- Use Aircrack-ng to assess the security of AVs' wireless communication.
- Implement tools to monitor and detect unauthorized access points and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Develop scripts in Python to automate the process of scanning and testing the wireless network security.

Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Design and implement an IDS specifically tailored for AV environments.
- Use Python to create detection algorithms that can identify suspicious behavior, such as unusual network traffic patterns or attempts to access restricted areas of the vehicle's network.

Data Encryption and Secure Communication
- Implement strong encryption protocols for data transmitted between AVs and their control centers.
- Use Python libraries (e.g., PyCryptodome) to develop encryption and decryption routines.
- Ensure secure key management practices.

Software Integrity and Vulnerability Management
- Develop a system for regularly checking the integrity of the AVs' software and firmware.
- Implement automated vulnerability scanning tools and integrate them with Python scripts to regularly update and patch software.

Incident Response and Recovery
- Create an incident response plan specific to cyber-attacks on AVs.
- Develop Python scripts to automate the detection of incidents and trigger predefined response actions, such as isolating compromised systems or initiating data backup procedures.
